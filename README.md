# Trading-bot-ai-trained
# AI Trading Model - Description & User Manual

## **Description**

This AI trading model is designed for algorithmic trading with a focus on achieving 70-80% accuracy, learning from its mistakes, and managing memory usage efficiently by keeping RAM consumption under 5GB. It combines technical indicators from libraries such as `ta-lib`, `finta`, and `ta`, and integrates machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for sequence prediction and classical models like RandomForest and XGBoost for classification. The model can be trained on financial data obtained from `yfinance` and is capable of backtesting strategies to evaluate performance before live deployment.

Key Features:
- **Trend Following and Momentum-based Strategy**: Uses indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, and ATR to analyze market trends and generate buy/sell signals.
- **AI Models**: Integrates RandomForest, XGBoost, and LSTM for prediction, with error-learning capabilities.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Keeps RAM usage below 5GB, utilizing disk storage when needed.
- **Data Filtering**: Filters and processes input data based on quality to improve accuracy during training.
- **Backtesting Support**: Includes backtesting functionality to test the model against historical data before real-time deployment.

## **User Manual**

### **1. Setup**

Before running the AI trading model, ensure all necessary Python packages are installed. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

#### **Installation Steps:**
1. Download the `requirements.txt` file and ensure it contains the following modules:
   ```txt
   backtrader==1.9.76.123
   yfinance==0.2.27
   ta==0.10.2
   finta==1.3
   tensorflow==2.13.0
   talib==0.4.0
   matplotlib==3.7.2
   joblib==1.3.2
   scikit-learn==1.2.2
   pandas==1.5.3
   numpy==1.23.5
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **2. Data Preparation**

You need to provide historical financial data in CSV format, organized by asset and year (e.g., `/path/to/data/BTC/2023/data.csv`). Ensure that the data has columns for `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `volume`.

If using `yfinance`, the model will automatically download the data for a specific asset. You can specify a stock ticker or cryptocurrency symbol.

### **3. Running the Model**

Use the following code to process, train, and test the AI model. It includes LSTM and machine learning models, error learning, and backtesting.

```python
# Assuming the final code is already structured with functions
best_models, best_lstm_model, accuracies = process_and_train_with_error_learning(
    input_directory='/path/to/your/data', 
    chunk_size=10000, 
    num_iterations=100
)
```

The model automatically loads your data, filters it for quality, and trains using various technical indicators. After training, the best models are selected based on performance.

### **4. Backtesting the Model**

The backtesting function allows you to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on historical data before deploying it in real-time trading.

```python
backtest_results = backtest_model(best_models, best_lstm_model, historical_data='/path/to/historical/data.csv')
```

This function will simulate trades based on historical data and calculate the returns and accuracy.

### **5. Deploying the Model**

Once the model is trained and tested, you can deploy it for real-time trading. You will need to integrate it with a trading API (e.g., Alpaca, Binance, or OANDA) to execute trades based on the model's predictions.

```python
deploy_model(best_lstm_model, live_data_source='yfinance', asset='BTC-USD')
```

This command will start live trading using the LSTM model and fetches real-time data from Yahoo Finance for the specified asset.

### **6. Saving and Loading Models**

After training, the models are automatically saved to disk. You can load them later for live trading or further analysis.

```python
# Saving the models
joblib.dump(best_models['xgboost'], '/path/to/save/model_xgb.pkl')
best_lstm_model.save('/path/to/save/lstm_model.h5')

# Loading the models
loaded_xgb = joblib.load('/path/to/save/model_xgb.pkl')
loaded_lstm_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('/path/to/save/lstm_model.h5')
```

### **7. Adjusting Parameters**

You can adjust model parameters, such as the number of iterations, chunk size, or features used, to optimize performance for your specific trading strategy. The model is flexible enough to work with different asset classes, including stocks, crypto, and forex.

### **8. Monitoring and Improving**

To further improve accuracy and error learning:
- Monitor performance during live trading.
- Record mistakes and retrain models regularly to adapt to new market conditions.
- Tune hyperparameters like learning rates, window sizes, and LSTM layers.

### **9. Troubleshooting**
- **Low Accuracy**: Increase data quality and quantity, adjust hyperparameters, or try different indicator combinations.
- **Memory Issues**: Ensure that disk storage is being used when RAM is constrained. Lower chunk size if needed.

By following this user manual, you can effectively run, backtest, and deploy an AI trading model that is optimized for your trading strategies.
